# Kageku Engine

## What is Kageku?

Kageku is a board game created as one of the mini games inside a RPG me and my friends play. More information about how it works in the repository of the python package created to play it: https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/kageku

## What is an engine?

An engine in the chess world is a common name for the artificial inteligences that play the game. Since Kageku is inspired by chess, I decided to use this term for the project.

## Why did you create this engine?

I'm a tryhard when it comes to competitive games. So I wanted to practice this game to have an edge on the other players when we play it on the RPG so I can get more money to buy my weapons and destroy them *evil laugh*.

### Inspirations

This engine is heavely inspired in a great series of videos "Programming A Chess Engine in C" by Bluefever Software on youtube. I used lots of tricks he teachs about how to optimize the code as best as possible. The main difference about the code in the video series and my code is the language (he's using pure C, I decided to use C++ and Object-Oriented Programming since I'm more familiar with it) and the game itself since although Kageku is inspired by Chess and both share a lot of rules, there are obviously some of them that are very different (for example the "spawning pieces with mana" thing on Kageku).
