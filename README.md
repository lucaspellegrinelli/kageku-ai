# Kageku Engine

## What is Kageku?

Kageku is a board game created as one of the mini games inside a RPG me and my friends play. More information about how it works in the repository of the python package created to play it: https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/kageku

## What is an engine?

An engine in the chess world is a common name for the artificial inteligences that play the game. Since Kageku is inspired by chess, I decided to use this term for the project.

## Why did you create this engine?

I'm a tryhard when it comes to competitive games. So I wanted to practice this game to have an edge on the other players when we play it on the RPG so I can get more money to buy my weapons and destroy them *evil laugh*.

## Next steps

- Create a proper heuristic function since all the search functions like Alpha-Beta, Quiescence, MVV LVA and stuff are already implemented. So to improve move ordering (and in consequence improve efficiency) and move quality this is crucial. Right now I'm thinking in what variables to take in consideration to create this.

### Inspirations

This engine is inspired in a great series of videos "Programming A Chess Engine in C" by Bluefever Software on youtube.
