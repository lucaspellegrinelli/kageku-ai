# Kageku Engine

This is an ongoing project of mine to create a engine that plays the game "Kageku". If you don't know what "Kageku" is, check out my other repo https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/kageku where I explain what it is, why it exists and provide a python package for playing it.

### Inspirations

This engine is heavely inspired in a great series of videos "Programming A Chess Engine in C" by Bluefever Software on youtube. I used lots of tricks he teachs about how to optimize the code as best as possible. The main difference about the code in the video series and my code is the language (he's using pure C, I decided to use C++ and Object-Oriented Programming since I'm more familiar with it) and the game itself since although Kageku is inspired by Chess and both share a lot of rules, there are obviously some of them that are very different (for example the "spawning pieces with mana" thing on Kageku).
