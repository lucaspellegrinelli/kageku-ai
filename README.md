# Kageku Engine

This is currently unfinished and I hope to get some free time to finish it.

If you don't know what "Kageku" is, check out my other repo https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/kageku

This code is an adaptating of the engine displayed at the awesome series of videos by Bluefever https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbc-Ky058TEaOstZHVbT-2hg that teaches the basics of creating a chess engine. The main differences from the video series and this project are the game rules and the language (he is using C and I decided to use C++ with OOP).
